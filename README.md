# ItemTweaks
A Minecraftmod like Crafting tweaks but for items

The idea of making such a mod was to let modpack developer easily create new simple items for crafting. During codeing The idea of manipulate existing items appeared due to an statement of @Halbzwilling where he said that he needs a configurable mod to sort his Items to CreativeTabs

Currently capable of:
<ul>
<li>change CreativeTab of Items</li>
<li>create new CreativeTabs</li>
</ul>
